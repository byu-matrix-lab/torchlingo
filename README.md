**TorchLingo** is an educational PyTorch library for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Designed for students and instructors, it provides a clean, well-documented implementation of the Transformer architecture for learning and experimentation.

## Features

- 🎓 **Educational Focus**: Clean, readable code designed for learning
- 🔄 **Transformer Architecture**: Full encoder-decoder implementation with multi-head attention
- 📝 **SentencePiece Tokenization**: BPE and Unigram subword models
- 🔁 **Back-Translation**: Data augmentation for improved translation quality
- 🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Train a single model for multiple language pairs
- 📊 **TensorBoard Integration**: Monitor training progress in real-time

## Installation

```bash
pip install torchlingo
```

For development:

```bash
pip install torchlingo[dev]
```

### Working from a clone

The example corpus and the pretrained checkpoint are stored in [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com).
Install it before cloning, or the two files arrive as short text pointers instead
of data and the tutorials that read them will not run:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/BYU-Matrix-Lab/torchlingo.git
```

Already cloned without it? `git lfs install && git lfs pull` fetches them.
